     Creates a recurring `Task` that executes until success
     - Parameters:
        - priority: TaskPriority
        - maxRetryCount: `Int` How many times to retry. Defaults to inifinity
        - retryDelay: Delay between retries
        - operation: The operation block to complete on each try
     - Returns: A `Task` that can be retained if you want to be able to cancel
     
     From within the `operation` block retturn the value you want access to on completion. The value can be accesses by reading `.value` from the `Task`
